// CHALLENGE # 1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. StoreMark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
// 3. Createa Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
// ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

let markMass = 78
const markHeight = 1.69
let johnMass = 92
const johnHeight = 1.95

const markBMI = markMass / markHeight ** 2
console.log(markBMI)

const johnBMI = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2
console.log(johnBMI)

let markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI
console.log(markHigherBMI)
