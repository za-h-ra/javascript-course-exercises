// Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

// 1. Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI. The message can be either:

// "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".

// 2. Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI values in the outputs.

// Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" or "John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!".

// Note: Don't round the BMI values. Leave them as they are.

const massMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const massJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

let BMIMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
let BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);

console.log(BMIMark);
console.log(BMIJohn);

let markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn;
console.log(markHigherBMI);

if (BMIMark > BMIJohn) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${BMIMark}) is higher than John's (${BMIJohn})!`);
} else {
  console.log(`John's BMI (${BMIJohn}) is higher than Mark's (${BMIMark})!`);
}
